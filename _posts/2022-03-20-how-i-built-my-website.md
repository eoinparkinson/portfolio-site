# Welcome

Hi, I see that you're interested in how I built this website - cool. There are two answers to this, the short one, and the long one. <!--more-->

# Short Answer

This site was generated using [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}. The theme is custom built by me and is available [here](https://github.com/eoinparkinson/portfolio-site){:target="_blank"} if you want to look around it or use it - it's open to everyone.
