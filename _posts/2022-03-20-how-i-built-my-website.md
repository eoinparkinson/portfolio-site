# Welcome

Hi, I see that you're interested in how I built this website - cool. There are two answers to this, the short one, and the long one.

# Short Answer

This site was generated using [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}. The theme is custom built by me and is available [here](https://github.com/eoinparkinson/portfolio-site){:target="_blank"} if you want to look around it or use it - it's open to everyone.

# Long Answer

As stated above, I'm using a static site builder called **[Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com)**{:target="_blank"}. This is for two main reasons:

1. Developer Experience:
2. Price

### Developer Experience

The **Developer Experience** with Jekyll has been top-class. Jekyll is a highly documented static site generator as it has been about since 2008 - giving the developer community time to build with it.

### Price

Secondly is the **price**, static sites cost much less than dynamic server rendered solutions, such as wordpress. In fact, this site doesn't cost me anything to host, I just pay for the domain.

Of course there are limitations to the free plan with any hosting provider, however with static sites it is always extremely generous.

### Content Management System - CMS

As with any website, updating the content should be made easy. That's why I've gone ahead and integrated [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), an open-source Content Management System that is well establish in the SSG scene.

NetlifyCMS integrates with your Git workflow, and pushes new changes directly to the site build files, so that when you invoke a new build, the new updated files will be applied to the site.

### Project Management

I am using [GitHub](https://www.github.com). This was a no brainer. GitHub has and always will be the backbone for all my projects.

### Time Inputted

The time taken to design this website has been 10+ **active** **hours** of work. 

### More

I'm always open to discussing my public projects - such as this one. If you've got any questions don't hesitate to contact me via social media, links to these are in the footer below.
